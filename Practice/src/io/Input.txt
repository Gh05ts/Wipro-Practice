So far, I’ve utilized all the above sensors using an Arduino Uno board with ATMega328 microcontroller. The majority of the time was spent on interfacing the sensors and modules, understand their working and troubleshooting the consequent problems that arose during the process. The MPU 6050 in particular is a very complicated device which is very hard to work with and still sometimes gives issues, if low cost was not a priority some other sensor such as a BNO055 9-DOF Absolute orientation or UM7 orientation would be preferred as they have better code support and are more accurate and user friendly, but their price is more than the whole cost of the current project therefore, this has been used instead. The soil moisture sensor is a plug and play for Arduino thanks to the Analog input pins featured on the board and was a breeze to use, but for a Raspberry pie it needs an ADC to use. The Sim900a can be tricky to use not because it’s hard in itself but setting up TCP/ IP takes some considerable amount of research online to figure out. The module can be used for HTTP as well as HTTPS communication too but they seem harder than TCP/ IP so I went with it. Thingspeak was used as the cloud platform as it’s readily connected through the TCP/ IP, but since it’s a free account it comes at the cost of only one sensor reading per 15 seconds.
